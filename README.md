Visit https://abulasar.dev/ to view live demo of the website

## About the Project
- This is my portfolio website built in Elixir and Phoenix LiveView. I have implemented few cool things like `Graphql` client for fetching blogs, Github Action for CI/CD, deployed it on Fly.io etc.
- I've shared my Resume and my previous experience.
- Please go through the code and feel free to use the code :) 


## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
